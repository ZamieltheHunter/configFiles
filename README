This is a collection of configurations I've used
The required programs are: zsh, oh-my-zsh(From Robby-Russells Github),
vim, conky(v 1.10), and openbox.

Openbox assumes you have some commands installed in order to execute certain
key-combinations.
It assumes you have: feh, dmenu, xfce4-terminal, oblogout, and xtrlock.
In addition it assumes your backgrounds are stored in $HOME/.backgrounds
that is where the script drops the ones that I've included.

The install script should symlink the files from here to their correct
places.
